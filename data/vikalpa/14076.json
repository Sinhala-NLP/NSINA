    "News Content": "In a war what the rebels look for is one weak gap from amongst several hundred gaps. From a military angle, the LTTE’s attack on the air force camp at Anuradahpura and inflicting a major damage on it was clever. According to some commentators the financial value of the damage was 30 million dollars. What they probably wanted to convey by such an attack was that the LTTE had not collapsed and that they were still capable of waging well planned surprise attacks.\nIt is not necessary for the country to go back to the position where Ranil Wickramasinghe stopped .Although there were positive and strong features in Ranil Wickramasinghe’s transactions with the LTTE there were negative and weak features too. The cease fire agreement can be considered an agreement reached on the basis of the political requirements of one party. The government needed such a strategy to retain its position in a context where the executive powers were in the hands of its opponent and the LTTE itself wanted a temporary agreement in order to achieve some acceptance for itself. In such conditions Ranil Wickramasinghe’s government had to function on the basis of a policy of pleasing the LTTE. The agreement reached was attractive from the outside but empty inside. As a consequence of that very fact Ranil Wickramasinghe was prevented from becoming the President by the LTTE itself, and a strong minded, President who would not easily succumb to the LTTE came to office. Thereafter the transaction between the two sides proceeded not by dialogue but by war. Now the balance of forces is not where it was at the time when Ranil Wickramasinghe started the discussions, but elsewhere.",
