    "News Content": "People’s sovereignty is believed to be a power of decision making exercised by the people of the whole country. Taking critical decisions as to what sort of governing system is conducive for oneself and whom would be more suitable for handling that system are important, among other rights in a democracy. Yet, the people exercise this power only once in a while – most probably, five to six year period. They are not in a position to reverse or withdraw a decision once taken, in a midway during the aforesaid period within which the elected person or the body of persons will in all probability conveniently replace the people as the sole arbitrator of the so-called sovereignty. Therefore, people’s sovereignty is restricted to a ruthless time frame.\nNow, almost all Sri Lankans know the system governing them is full of defects. Very often we hear people complaining about “a fault in the system”. Though there is widespread frustration and disillusionment over the Presidential System, Proportional Representation and Preferential Voting system etc, no concrete action has been taken so far to rectify these social and political maladies. Best example is the invincible Presidential system, which triumphantly survives in spite of the written pledges publicly sworn by Ms. Chandrika Bandaranayake and incumbent President Mr. Mahinda Rajapakse, to abolish it.\nA tadpole resembles in appearance to a little fish. A political candidate in Sri Lanka is like a tadpole. In spite of earnestly wishing to bate a fish we always end up in catching a tadpole in the guise of a fish. When this tadpole metamorphoses into a frog it is already in power, no more a candidate (tadpole) but an elected leader (frog) delegated to exercise or rather to enjoy the people’s sovereignty. So, people will have to wait for another 5-6 years to elect another one, hoping this time to catch a real fish without fail. Yet, at that time too it happens to be a tadpole, the sole reason being not having any fish in this swamp but tadpoles, tadpoles and tadpoles. Then why do we repeat the same folly knowing very well the outcome would be the same? \nKeeping this in mind we will now turn to our present predicament. If I am asked what Marxism is I can fairly well explain it in terms of a new understanding not to be found in any other ‘ism’. If I am asked what Buddhism is I can conceptualize a rather different set of precepts not found in any other religion. But if I am asked what Mahinda Chinthanaya is I am at a loss since I do not comprehend any tenets even remotely akin to a fresh understanding of our condition. Yet, this pseudo Political Manifesto was triumphantly brandished as a newfound manna directly sent from the heaven to redeem the poor sinners of Sri Lanka! I call this a fiction.\nJanatha Vimukthi Peramuna popularly identified with Marxism has no qualms in clamoring for a brutal military solution to the National Question and has no shame in being vociferous collaborators of a movement called Desha Hithaishee Janatha Viyaparaya (People’s Patriotic Movement) which is blatantly racist. They do not seem to comprehend that religion when co-opted as a social and institutional force in matters of governance would ultimately tend to tarnish the secular nature of the state, a sine qua non in Marxist theory of state. In spite of having fresh experience in being brutally crushed by the Army not very long ago, still they do not seem to perceive armed forces as main repressive organs of the state, in so much as to volunteering to defend some military personnel alleged to have been involved in a sex scandal while serving in Haiti on a UN peace keeping mission! Therefore, I suggest that the notorious incident of Premawathie Manamperi who was proved beyond any doubt in a court of justice to have been raped and brutally murdered by the members of the security forces in 1971 is a fiction! Furthermore, talking about a Batalanda is weirdly meaningless!\nGamini Viyangoda\n[email protected] ",
