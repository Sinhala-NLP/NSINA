    "News Content": "We can understand Rajapakse government’s furious rejection of any sanction against Musharraf. At the moment, Pakistan is the friendliest country of Sri Lanka, whose supply line of military wherewithal is crucial in Sri Lanka’s raging war against the LTTE. So, for a government whose very survival depends solely on a much-anticipated military victory over the LTTE, cannot afford to lose a priceless friend, though a despicable dictatorship detested by its own people, like Pakistan.\nBut, how can our Opposition which is diametrically opposed to Rajapakse’s war mentality, and allege that the present war carried out by the Rajapakse government is nothing but a ruse to justify its anti-democratic trends and human rights violations, claim to be in favor of a ruler like Musharraf? How in their thinking, can Bogollagama’s acquiescence in sanctioning an autocrat be labeled as “treacherous” to the nation?\nOur Opposition has no right to support Pakistan just because it happens to be the military supplier in our war efforts. For, they stand in principle for a political solution eschewing military options as non-viable. On the other hand, our Opposition portrays government’s war campaign as inefficient and full of corruption in acquiring military equipments; Mig 27 aircraft deal being one in the list of serious allegations of corruption. Mushrraf’s adventure in detaining Pakistani Chief Justice, civil activists, lawyers, academics- in short, political enemies of all hues- and declaring a state of emergency and refusing to renounce his commanding position in the Army (yesterday he relinquished it under severe international pressure) are being explained away in the name of combating terrorism. Human rights violations, abductions, killings and media suppression in Sri Lanka are also justified in the same manner under the banner “rescuing our motherland from the clutches of terrorism”.\nReason? Even the notorious “War On Terrorism” campaign by George W Bush does not need uncomfortable dictatorships anymore as buddies. Democratic governments can be used just as efficiently for the same purpose, which means Benazir Bhuto or Navaz Sherrif can be more legitimately called upon to service for the purpose of combating terrorism. \nSome time back we were so rigidly moralistic in our foreign policy matters that we didn’t hesitate to punish all the cricketers who participated, without heeding a government ban, in a cricket match with the national team of apartheid South Africa. Until 1977 we had no diplomatic relations with Israel, in the belief that Israel was carrying out an aggressive policy against Palestinian people. In spite of the fact that the ideological divide between the two super powers at the time may have had some bearing on these foreign policy dimensions, some common sense of ethical norms also prevailed.\nGamini Viyangoda\n[email protected] ",
