    "News Content": "Tens and thousands of children displaced because of this War. Their rights to food, shelter, freedom, and education are violated. We all know the child’s life in a refugee camp. It is miserable.\nThe government doesn’t have a peaceful solution to this ethnic conflict. Unfortunately some authorities insist military solution in publicly. The children of these powerful people are not deprived of rights. It is all right. But what happened to the other marginalized children? All of these children who belong to elite class or marginalized groups are the trustees of the future of this beautiful island.\nThe state has a duty to make life of all most all children happy. The article 27 said every child has the right to a standard of living adequate to his or her physical, spiritual, normal and social development. Parents have the primary responsibility to ensure that the child has an adequate standard of living. The state’s duty is to ensure that this responsibility can be fulfilled and is. The state’s responsibility can include material assistance to parents and their children.",
