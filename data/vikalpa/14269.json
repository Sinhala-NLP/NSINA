    "News Content": "Although we are on the school holidays extra classes are held in the school. No doubt all the girls and guys love attending them. Further we know that the exam is close and we should try hard. And one day as usual we went to school and class ended in 3 hours. Some students left. Rest stayed with the teacher till their parents come to fetch them and discussing the next day’s lesson.\nKanchi went to the gate with three of her friends Anupama, Ishara and Rahim. They were there for two three minutes and Kanchi and the two guys whose parents were not there returned while Anupama left. It didn’t take a minute for the Principal of our school to appear at the door. The whole class was steady and silent.\n“Who was the girl at the gate? It was you right? Stand up!”\nKanchi stood up. “To whom were you talking to at the gate? The Guy?”\nKanchi was silent and the teacher answered “It was one of this class. Ishara”. She pointed him to stand up and he did.\n“There was another one!” said the Principal.\nRahim also stood up.\n“Then who is the guy who left the gate seeing me?”\n“Sir, it wasn’t a guy. It was Anupama. A girl of the same class”\n“A girl? Oh a girl in a boy’s school uniform? Don’t try to fool me. You better know that you can’t hide anything from me! I saw him leaving, of course I did. Don’t let me ever catch you playing around!”\nMy dear Sir was steady in his opinion and asked the teacher not to have any extra class for us anymore. He was tough and looked powerful, we were pretty scared. A teacher and nearly twenty children were there to swear that Anupama was not a boy. But he didn’t hear any. \nI really don’t think our Principal sir was fair.",
