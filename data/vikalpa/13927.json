    "News Content": "I read, with great pain of mind, Ruki’s article on “Jaffna: Tears, Blood and Terror” posted on ‘Groundviews” on December 11, 2007. The comments on the article were no less moving. I agree with all that has been said.\nThe humiliation and the deprivations suffered by the Tamils and referred to by Ruki are real and pathetic. Tamils have done nothing on their part to deserve such treatment. They may have had better opportunities before Independence but that was not their fault. It was a part of the ‘divide and rule policy’ of the imperialists. In my experience, Tamils have always been hard-working, hospitable, amicable and peace-loving, as a people. The War which is the root-cause of their suffering is not their creature.\nThe LTTE is generally blamed for starting the war but who pushed them into it? Decades of negotiations between leaders of both sides only led to the holocaust of 1983. The war is a product of desperation born of the lethargy, short-sightedness and cowardice on the part of all those who were in power after Independence. In any case, war has at the least, given a sense of urgency to the search for a solution to the ethnic conflict and some measure of confidence to the Tamils who were exposed to periodic ‘purges’.\nThe Army has not marched into the North on their own. The war is not their creation either and they have no private axe to grind as evidenced by the words of the soldier quoted in Ruki: “we hope peace can come and we can go back and stay in our own lands without occupying other people’s lands”\nThe South itself is not immune to danger. Murderous explosions cause death and mayhem there to the Sinhalese, personally ‘guiltless of (their) country’s blood.’ Memories of discriminations suffered under foreign rule haunt the Sinhala majority. They are obsessed by the paranoia of losing the clout of their numbers in a constitutionally balanced society. \nThe solution lies in working out a just and balanced system of power-sharing. Then only will the cog-wheels move together positively. But when will that be? For three generations, there have been ‘words, words and words’ but no resolution of the conflict in sight. \nRound-Table Conferences, All-Party Representative Committees, Expert Panels are all too familiar to us. They are only a means of dragging the issue into confusion till the cows come home, reminding one of the proverbial native physician who called for seven packets of a non-existent oil to cure a malady that he could not diagnose. A solution is promised ‘tomorrow, and tomorrow and tomorrow’ but the day never comes.\nThe day cannot come in a country whose leaders do not have the guts to control their men – leaders who would stake the future of the land for one more day in power. The only solution appears to be enlightening the electorate at least at this late stage, on how to elect their leaders. \nI concluded my article in the “Daily Mirror”, on “Let Us Realize the Kannangara Dream”, with the words:\n‘the challenge will be to evolve a ‘Katikavata’ on National Goals and set up machinery to regularly review progress, proclaim levels of performance and whip up public enthusiasm, so that the People can make informed decisions on those whom they choose to usher in a ‘just, contented and vibrantly progressive society.’",
