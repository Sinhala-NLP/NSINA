    "News Content": "Mihin air, Mihin cost of living, Mihin law, Mihin entourage and Mihin war are making people’s life miserable. \nThe cost of living is unbearable. The poor turn into poorer. Unfortunately some sons related to my uncles elite flying in the city by 45 million worth night rider cars. They Sunday Times on September 9 2007 headline was “glitz and blitz at New York Ritz for huge Lankan delegation. I still remembered my uncle’s entourage to China several months ago. This time will be participating to UN General assembly.\nThe delegation will be comprise of 65 members. The New York Ritz Carton hotel has been booked for the delegation. Each suite booked at priced US$ 2500(RS 275000)per night. UN’s attitude towards my uncles ruling will be change to unimaginable worse. I hope UNs attitude towards his countrymen will not change.For how long? The silent of people says that they agrred to all misdeeds of their ruler.\nMihin uncle’s law enforcement authority is unsuccessful. Crime is increasing. Delgoda massacre, killing of Panadura Pinwatte youths and the rape and murder of AL student at Passara Maha Vidyalaya were some which annoyed the public. The latest incident is minister’s son took law into his own hands and brutally assaulted one person. All these incidents symbolizes the collapse of Rule of Law and unrespectable to Human Rights.\nHow nice going to New York by Mihin air. But the huge expenditure will be cover up from people’s pockets. It will also be peculiar to boast about country’s human rights situation at the UN general assembly. My uncles voters are calm and quite. But they new the executive president of this pearl of the Indian ocean is not an owner but a guardian. The utmost duty of a guardian is to protect the life and property of his countrymen. ",
