But Piumi could win a world pageant tittle. If Piumi can change her dressing sense and her attitude a little she would go a long way with the highest fan following in Sr Lanka. Piumi is beautiful but her dressing sense is too revealing and appealing. Piumis acting also very good. I watched her latest film. Nothing is wrong with her acting though. And happy shes being invited by an Indian film. ",

Neither has any class to speak of but maybe Udari’s dress sense is a tad better than Piumi’s. Well acting of course I think they are both better models & they should stick to modelling. They aren’t beautiful or talented to be classed as actresses. An actress does not need good looks but she should be talented, like maybe Nadee Kammallaweera or Samanali Fonseka in today’s generation or you have to have the glamour factor to a certain extent, maybe like Puja Umashankar but these two have none ",
