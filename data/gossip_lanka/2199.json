The true love towards your neighbor make him very happy  That’s his system and you may not understand because he created the universe and the space and time and all the programming codes behind everything.  it’s very complicated stuff and you may not understand within one life time  You are just a player in Gods multiplayer video game.  Be good and Sacrify your self for others That’s the only way to level up.  Try to hack this game with Buddhism won’t work but you can use Buddhism to gain extra points Good luck and Ready Palyer One.

Only this priest sacrificed/ gave his incubator to someone.so I guess this should be more than a spectacular event. It’s an even where the whole world should speechless becuz none would sacrifice their incubator during a period like this. Oh and btw God does exist. Who are you to tell everyone that God does not exist. Becuz there’s a God and becuz he’s love is an extraordinary one, ppl like this even existed in the 21st century. God does exist. God is not someone who you imagine or think he is. God is someone who’s beyond our imagination and thoughts. He is real. Mark my word, you will see him in the coming days. Don’t be so cruel at a time like this to tell that there’s no God. Your comment shows what kind of low quality person you are. If u think there’s no God , keep it for yourself :) ",

One thing is clear that religion makes someone crazy, intolerant of other;s view and paranoid. You are entitled to say that God (utter rubbish though) exist as much as I say the opposite. None can prove it or disprove it. This is like a fairly story. Religion tells us good story, fairy story and romanticize us. Islam and Christianity is in the forefront. ",

Just take a look at urself on the mirror and u will get a better understanding of what utter rubbing really means. And here plz, if u don’t want to believe in God don’t do so, stop commenting and showcasing ur low qualities by trying to prove that there’s no God since you’ll die off and God will always and forever and ever be worshipped on the lamer Earth.
