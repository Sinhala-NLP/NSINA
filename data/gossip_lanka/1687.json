The Nurses Dhammika and Euginee were assisting the surgeries and when they asked why this procedure was done by these Muslim doctors, the doctors said it was due to reduce bleeding.  After some time when these mothers wanted to have more babies they did not conceiveand they came back to the hospital and complained about it. The investigations found ot that the fallopian tubes are damaged due to clamping done during the previous C-section. The mothers with husbands wanted to take legal action but the hospital authorities did not want to proceed. Dr Kapila Gunawardena was the head of the Peradeniya hospital at that time and since he was retiring after a few months, he did not want to to get involved.  The nurses were willing to testify against these 2 Muslim doctors. Dr Shiraj immediately got a transfer to Ashrof Memorial hospital in Kalmunai and the woman doctor just disappeared (Both have left the country now.)  affected mothers and husbands please come forward. Recently this was revealed in many websites and newspapers......... ",

They know that they need Sinhalese workers mainly due to the fact that the 90% of customers are Sinhalese. Is Hemas exporting anything other countries? Other thing is that they can not find the skill set they need only from Muslim society. Most of them are more concerned about their religion and entangled with multiple marriages as allowed by Zaria law. We should have one common law. Sinhalese should form a one party and select a leader from it by an internal party vote or through preferential votes. We can have a system for voting for the party and preference for the leader on the same ballot. This will allow the leader to take decisions and resolve national issues instead of leaning on minority parties and doing favours to win their votes. Rishard Badurdeen has become a king maker for the time being because of UNP desperation. People will vote Rajapakse thinking Riri yaka is better than mahasona. ",
