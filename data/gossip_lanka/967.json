They don't know how to choose the right makeup to match their skin color.  Most of the Asian women have naturally beautiful Olive complexion which is prettier than western white.  I don't understand why our women can't accept our original natural skin color.  I personally don't like and don't wear any makeup. ",

First they chose a foundation that’ll make them fairer. Foundation is to smoothen your own complexion not to make you look lighter skinned. Anyway then they wear it only on the face and look like a ghost. Then they fix their false eyelashes and then smack red lipstick! It’s horrendous. No sense of makeup or class. ",

They have only two color foundation. One is beige and the other one is yellow. What these salon people do is just mix these two colors and apply on the face whoever comes they do not look into their exact skin tone and the other thing is Lankan make up artists know only one type of make up and they do that to everyone. They do not consider about the function, skin tone, their age or nothing. This is the problem with our make up artists. Actually I have very bad experience in doing make up at Lankan salons. These people are not innovative or creative at all. 'Pulli gona purudukaraya' range make up only they do ",
