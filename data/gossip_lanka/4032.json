When a country is in a dire straits and has no other alternative, it can request ( rather beg) the assistance of IMF. IMF can help you to put your house in order and once you have lifted your nose above water, it is up to you to make sure that you follow the correct and required steps and changes to g to formulate development strategies. It is a fund and not a development bank. It is the World Bank ( the actual name of which is World Bank of Reconstruction and Development). When you are in a would path, the Word Bank and other develi=opment banks such as Asian Development Bank, could come to our help. I am sure Ranil is much more mature and knowledgable in this matter than both you and I. Do not get things mixed up just because all Tom Dick and Harry utter these simplistic jargons. These are for Tilvin Silva and other fellows who have no other motive but to see that Sri Lanka would go down economically so they could grab power. We have to be pragmatists. Just study how India, in 1970, did with IMF aid and salvaged it from its financial problem. ",
