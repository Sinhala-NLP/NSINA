They will never be tamed or good because religious preaching or listening to good people advices. If they have a genetical disorder/criminal mind, then they will continue with their bad behaviour. We have seen serious crimes committed by the children of very good parents. We have seen the owner of the butchery goes to temple and do meditation and trying to attain Nibbana. Our people are relatively better than other nations. Our people are more hospitable and less selfish than other nations. You should not bring sacred beautiful religion or philosophy in to the miserable things by some rascals in our country. Saharan massacred innocent hundreds of innocent people in our country and you might ask what is happening in this Buddhist country. Muslims and Tamils have misused majority Sinhalese Buddhist people’s peaceful minds. The Bottomline is Buddhism or any other religion can not tame any criminal minds as their religion is crimes. However, we should accept the fact that Buddhism has no where stated not to embrace/practice another religion. ",
