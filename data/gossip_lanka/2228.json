            "comment": " As of 20th April, there had been about 12500 Covid 19 related deaths in UK. Only 20% of this has been from Black Asian Minority Ethnic (BAME) back ground.Out of this 20% a very high percentage is coming from boroughs such as Harrow, Brent, and Barnet in London. These Borrows have a very high population density of BAME background. So it is natural that the death rate from these areas have contributed to a high number. I am sure that there will be further investigation in to these statistics in the future. But, just like to add something that I have experienced. Some of the households in theses areas of London have very large families (Especially Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities). Some of them have about 9 or 10 members living in the same houses. Many of them have poor English communication abilities and poor hygiene habits. This has contributed to a rapid spread of the virus in such densely populated areas. The point is, if someone is suggesting that BAME communities are treated as second class citizens in UK, it is a totally uneducated opinion that should not made in public, and is a disgrace to NHS where a large number of Doctors and Nurses are also from BAME backgrounds. So, if you have relatives, children, or any other known people in UK, Please don't be afraid that they are treated differently. They are certainly not. I am not saying that we don't have racism in UK. But what some of these people are saying in public are not true. ",

Please do not put your own country people's morale down. Where ever we are still we all are Sri Lankans and don't forget that most of the Sri lankan living in abroad have served to SL for many many years before they migrate to these countries. None of the government has not looked at the 'professional migration' which is on going issue in SL.__When we talk about the minority who are dying in UK, one thing they talk about is their genetic and other underlying health issues. Asians are more prone to have heart failure/cholesterol issue which relates with their genes and likewise black people are heavily exposed to high blood pressure. On the top of that we as black minority donot bother about healthier life styles like the white people do such as exercises, low sugar, fat and green food etc ",
