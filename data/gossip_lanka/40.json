Europeans do not come to sri lanka because of it's beauty but because it is a tropical country. They want to catch some sun shine during theur long cold dark winters. Think why we have our tourist season during their wintertime! Europeans love sun shine. It is normal because they do not have much sun shine. As for this year, switzerland did not have a single sunny week-end this year. Last three days were very warm days. It was the first time that people could wear shorts this year. And the summer will be over in 2 months. tourists combine their beach holidays with a round trip but there are very few tourists who come to sri lanka only for a round trip. Do not listen to what \"one german\" told you. Germans love to travel and do visit many countries during their annual holidays. They even go to italy only for 4 days during easter week end and block swiss highways. The blocks are long as 19-12 km some times. All in all, sri lanka is not better than other countries. May be even getting worse now. I see how people throw away used plastic bags, bottles every where when they visit nice places. It is a matter of time that these places too would not be that beautiful one dax soon. ",

Some people think our ruined cities are very attractive. But comparing the ruins in Myanmar, Cambodia and Greece our ancient cities are nothing. Not even our women can attract foreigners like Thailand. Sri Lankan women are considered dark skinned and unattractive. But both foreign men and women are attracted to the Sri Lankan men. That is our main part in tourism. Don't think we have any more natural o cultural beauty. That is the bitter truth. ",

People are friendly and helpful. Very clean toilets and hotels are plentiful. Easy access to any part of the country. But that doesn't say sri lanka is not beautiful.  Sri Lanka is very beautiful too. May be the one of the worst tourist destinations counted on cleanliness, transport, exorbitant prices and touts.
