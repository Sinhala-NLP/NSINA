Kangaroo route (UK-Australia) is one of the world's busiest twin-city travel routes. Even now, the shortest route between UK and Australia falls via Colombo. More than 20 airlines, including Chinese and Indian airlines are currently plying the Kangaroo route but Sri Lankan has an advantage because Colombo is right in the middle of the route and it will be the fastest. So if Sri Lankan Airlines can successfully tap the travel market between London and Australia, like Air Ceylon did in the past, we can come back to the old glory again! ",

In this matter we don't have much tourist from Europe and they fly to Bangkok. Please think about this matter as well and with my own experience these all flights are fully booked at all times and profitable. think about please. ",
