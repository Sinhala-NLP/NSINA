Any filthy rich person the next step is to seek for more glamour and status is embark to politics, their 2 children Navin, Mayantha doing the same.Even Athulathmudali did the same. Media, boasts about he initiated mahapola scholarships, it is not big issue , the scholarship provided by tax payers money , our own money , not athulathmudali personal money! so no big deal! We know for 70 years our politicians have done nothing instead sucking blood from SL enjoying status and luxury from our money and making the country one of debt ridden countries the poor suffers. Just consider what Gamini Disa did for Mahawali, you dont need a minister who has no idea of construction for Mahaweli, so he is not required, the loans will be granted by the British government, and once a world renowned consulting engineers and construction company is appointed then they will implement the project. Minister and the politicians are just not required for these works. But the media will say GD did all the work as they are given bribes money by the GD/politicians. In develop countries ministers presidents are not involved in gigantic projects, rather specialists in such field such as engineers handle the work, and they want name projects under politicians names either! We should salute The dead woman Srimani, or Ahulathmudali or Gamini have they written substantial part of their enormous wealth to the poor? If not they also just fake and their demises is not a cause for sorrow! So even if Gamini Lalith were there nothing would have change unless they have stopped corruption and also make the legal system works fare for all , which they will never do! ",

Politicians call their actions the leadership to show they are doing something to the public. You cannot compare the leadership in China (where the whole parliament is top class engineers, yes parliament is 9 people and 8 are engineers including the president) ) and Singapore where highly qualified accountable ministers and the law and order prevails, complete contrast to our leaders and country! Just as an example of infrastructure development, do you know how they built a road in Australia? It is a complete contrast to what happens in Sri Lanka. No decisions and leadership at all from politicians as thye have no idea how a road or bridges are made. Once the road traffic is increased above a set value as per relevant Australian Standards and other researched facts, the local road authority justifies the necessity of an expressway road. After financial allocation is made available, the road construction begins. No auspicious time, no priests preaching, nothing, just starting the work on the road. Once the road is completed, the authority officers check whether road complies with Australian Standards, and then the road is opened. No politicians need be involved. same with power plants! The politicians should have no time to waste being otherwise occupied with genuine matters. But in Sri Lanka, when a road is opened all the politicians and their supporters come wasting man hours and money! ",

Well why do you need person like Gamini Dissa( a weaker student in Trinity end up as lawyer ( this profession is meant for low IQ students as the profession has no creativity , technical capability etcetc ), can he advise on how to construct the dam? how to check its stability, what can go wrong , absolutely nothing! As far as dam construction is concerned his contribution is not required as he is not capable to do so! Once money is allocated then the rest is with the construction team and Gamini or any politicians are not required, the contractor will deliver the job on time! Most politicians in the world use the term 'leadership'to protect their ignorance! Sorry Sanaboy that is the truth even though it is bitter! The world has developed because the scientific advancement by scientists engineers etc, Sanaboy do you know that due to recent advancement in engineering with nanorobots, artificial intelligence and 3 D printing , people can live healthy without sickness for a long long time!
