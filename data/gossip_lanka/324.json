Unrelated to this, but I have to tell you that (not so politically correct but shall point out the truth), having those girls as the drummers is appalling! I tell you this as myself was a drummer and a dancer years back and this is considered as a gross violation of our ancient traditions. In the superstitious world its being said as damnation, \"Vas wadinawa\". The point about this is that sometime our traditions shouldn't be pervaded with our so called \"modernised thinking\". I can only assume in this case its being done as a feminist gesture; but I wish in future we all go this journey together while appreciating and preserving our traditions. In the end traditions and history are what makes us who we are; these are imperative to our culture and way of life. Without such a thing to relate to we become alienated in our own land with an identity crisis; and believe me it is really easy to see this from being outside of SL than in. So the point is lets please all appreciate what our ancestors have left us; and believe me if you attempt to truly find it, it'll make you a lot more happy and give you a lot of contentment. Cheers guys! ",
