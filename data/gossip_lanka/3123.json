Everything is done using computers and remote work is more than possible to get it done faster. Why they took a complete year to get this done? The impact to the children is huge and damage is inomus to the kids. Some kids has to sit for the 2021 exam and some had to wait until get this fu&&king number to decide their future plans like going abroad or starting other professional courses (which needs more money) like computer, tech, cookery etc. So SAD!

            "comment": " Exactly. Every year OL and AL paper marking is done within 2 weeks. Then results take at least 6 months. Z score takes 6 more months. If the time is taken for data entry that is a waste of 300,000 years of the most productive years of youth. At minimum wage thats Rs. 30Billion or more!!!!!!!!!!!! That's about half of what government spends on Education !!!!!!!!!!!! ",
