The best site is none of mentioned in comments but weather. Com.  The USA based website which is 100% accurate and I always use it before even driving in mountain areas such as Truckee in East California and western Nevada. They are so correct and predict the % precipitation and the time.  Do not blame others when you do not have facts. Sri Lanka meteorology is a joke ",

Therefore weather forecasting is difficult with less resources. USA is using weather modelstation with big computer power that Sri Lanka even can't think in next decade.They also use satellite technology. But they also failed some times like when cyclone-Katrina hits,many people were died. Anyway DoM Sri Lanka have to improve their communication systems to give correct idea to people. ",
