Think about recently concluded pakistan ODIs. They couldn't find a single talent from 5 matches because they used same failed players. Way to go SLC more whitewashes are on your way. ",

There is a saying that your face showcases your hear. Can you imagine the caliber of cricketers we have had. Roy, Duleep, Rumesh, Madugalle, Wettimuni, Roshan, Arjuna, Hashan, All were pleasant and extremely talented than this bunch and moreover they had discipline to shave their beards and look like gentlemen. These players are not bothered about it and certainly look like loiterers and no talent inside as well. We should over haul our cricket with a new structure plus discipline to represent them the Nation in the International arena. Not like this. Think a second........ ",
