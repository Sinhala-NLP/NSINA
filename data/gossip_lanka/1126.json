So the story portrayed by doctors that medicine is only for the brainy is a complete false concept, infact the education dept statistics done in the past shows; engineering fac 70%, next come science fac maths/physics stream ( who missed the EFac) 52%, next Med fac 37%, so u can see very weak students were in the med fac.I nfact most medical advancements are not from doctors but from physicists , engineers, who have even won the Nobel Prize for Medicine, So our country should produce more 3 passes students to become doctors by opening more faculties, they still will do well as the diagnosis is not creative but simple, standard procedures, when it comes to surgery it will be practice and not really brains. In fact IBM has made computers which can replace Physicians with ease and these high IQ computers are more accurate than their human doctors. ",

Are you saying that an average engineer knows about subatomic particles, Higgs fields, and gravitational waves?  Why isn't there a Nobel prize for Engineering ?  In my opinion, a 'doctor wanna be' must have above average IQ ( not as much as a theoretical physicist or a mathematician) PLUS a good sympathetic HEART. ",

The very reason SL doctors can't make connections and tend to prescribe the whole pharmacy for a common cold is their limited preliminary education. Their immaturity and lack of social intelligence are more reasons. In Sri Lanka, the mentality is to NOT give people opportunities. Dumb them down and not lift each other up.
