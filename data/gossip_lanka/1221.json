If you know how Rome and Greece have vanished by natural disasters you will learn what happen to those Kaama Bogee lives. By creating such opportunities even, you cannot Colette your satisfaction. Your desire will never end! So this is an futile effect. Most of the western young crowd now have collapsed family Ives! As Asians you have to focus to your partner and should live your short period of life with satisfaction. All these western people are appraising the values of Asian life.

Rome or Greece did not fell due to natural disasters. That happened due to internal conflicts and most importantly invading armies like Alexander the Great and Visigoths. You need to read a history book. Also, natural disasters do not happen due to sin. It happens due to Utu Niyama. You need to read a book or two in Buddhism too. Also dont forget that prostitution was common in pre-colonized Sri Lanka. Maybe we were conquered because of that sin?  I live in a western world with a \"Collapsed family lives\". But most families that I know live very happily and lovingly. Also, most of the Asians that I know are doing there best to migrate into this collapsed western sociaty.  I cannot believe that there are morons who still believe that kaama bogee lives bring natural disasters. These are the stuff that was told by illiterate tribal people. ",
