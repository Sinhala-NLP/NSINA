Once i saw at the airport and the good thing was nobody didn't even give a shit attention to her. She always look down to people. Compared to Sridevi she cannot even come closer to her. There is a lot for new actors to learn from Sridevi. She was so polite and sweet towards people. She is given the highest respect to her funeral too. And she's being declared as an Indian national treasure. She's a goddess ",
