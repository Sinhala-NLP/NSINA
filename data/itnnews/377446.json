The ‘blood moon’ was one of the last astronomical events of 2021 and Chile was a privileged setting to observe it for an average time of three-and-a-half hours. It is known as an ‘almost total’ lunar eclipse, where the natural satellite is covered by a shadow in up to 99.1%. Additionally, the Moon turned red due to a phenomenon where the only sunlight reaching it passes through Earth’s atmosphere. According to NASA, the last one took place in February 18, 1440. During a lunar eclipse, the Sun, Earth and Moon align so that the Moon passes into Earth’s shadow. According to specialists, these events are not just fascinating to look at, but they also allow observations and measurements to study the moon itself and even the Earth’s atmosphere in an indirect way.
