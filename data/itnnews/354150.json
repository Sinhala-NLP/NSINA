South Korea has been battling its largest wave of infections so far, though vaccinations among vulnerable populations and key workers have limited serious cases. These medical workers — often wearing heat-trapping protective clothing — are now able to enjoy their breaks at the buses set up outdoors in places such as parking lots near coronavirus testing centres. They are allowed to take off their protective suits while resting in capsule style seats in the bus. The 22 buses, which were originally used as resting spaces for police officers and firefighters, have been deployed on a rotating basis across the country since July 26, according to the Health Ministry. “The working environment for them (medical workers) is similar to that of firefighters, so we decided to provide disaster site recovery buses to help them,” Shin Yeol-woo, Fire Commissioner of South Korea’s National Fire Agency told Reuters. The National Fire Agency said some buses are equipped with shower booths and bunk beds, and stocked with cups of instant noodles and kimchi. The agency is considering providing another 82 fire station buses upon request by local government. South Korea reported 1,202 new COVID-19 cases for Monday (August 2) raising the total to 202,203 infections, with 2,104 deaths. The country detected its first two cases of the new Delta Plus COVID-19 variant on Tuesday.
