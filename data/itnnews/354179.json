Seven fires were still burning, fanned by temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104°F), strong winds and low humidity, Forestry Minister Bekir Pakdemirli said. Meteorology maps show areas affected by fires have suffered severe drought in recent months. Television images showed huge flames engulfing the hills of Manavgat. The heatwave exacerbating the fires comes after months of exceptionally dry weather in Turkey’s southwest, according to maps issued by meteorological authorities. Sixteen planes and 51 helicopters tackled the blazes across a swathe of southwest Turkey. The European Union said it had helped mobilise three fire-fighting planes on Sunday. One from Croatia and two from Spain joined teams from Russia, Iran, Ukraine and Azerbaijan.
