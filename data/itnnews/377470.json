Some migrants have made use of the recently organised repatriation flights to Iraq, but according to activist Ragaz Kamal – founder of NGO ’17Shubat for human rights’ – some of them will try to come back to Europe again in the summer. Kamal said that many Kurdish people stuck at the Belarusian-Polish border are in need of immediate humanitarian aid, and called upon the Polish government to allow human rights activists access to the exclusion zone around the border. Kamal told Reuters that, according to their statistics, 27,000 people left Iraqi Kurdistan within the last 11 months for Europe.
