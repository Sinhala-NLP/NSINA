China has reported a cluster of COVID-19 infections in the past month, with 328 new locally transmitted confirmed cases registered in July, a number almost equal to the country’s total number in the previous five months. The country’s latest novel coronavirus outbreak stems mainly from a flight that departed from Russia and landed in Nanjing, capital of east China’s Jiangsu Province. Further viral genome sequencing has found that all the strains in the recent resurgence of COVID-19 were the highly infectious Delta variant, according to the National Health Commission. The government of Jiangsu’s Yangzhou City added 15 medium-risk areas of COVID-19 on Monday. The city now has one high-risk area and more than 30 medium-risk areas. Starting from Sunday, the city has set up inspection stations at all roads and only passengers with negative results of nucleic acid tests taken within 48 hours can enter or leave the city. Besides, all the public-transit buses, taxis and online car-hailing service have been suspended in the city. Also on Monday, the municipal government of Huai’an, Jiangsu Province, lifted six places to medium-risk areas. The government issued a statement on Monday, suspending operation of two bus terminals starting from 00:00 Tuesday. There are one high-risk area and 30 medium-risk areas in Nanjing. For cases under the age of 14, Nanjing has set up special wards in designated hospitals. All the child COVID-19 patients in the city are in stable condition. On Monday, Nanjing launched the fourth round of mass nucleic acid testing in 58 sub-districts and towns in nine districts, and sampling is expected to be completed before 24:00 on Tuesday. All scenic spots in Nanjing have been closed. Zhengzhou, capital city of central China’s Henan Province, had reported 13 locally transmitted confirmed COVID-19 cases by 18:00 Monday in the latest resurgence of COVID-19, local authorities said Monday. “Amid the current round of COVID-19 outbreak, Zhengzhou City has reported 13 locally transmitted confirmed cases and 50 asymptomatic cases. Results of viral genome sequencing showed that the first two cases were highly homologous with confirmed imported cases from Myanmar under treatment at the sixth people’s hospital of Zhengzhou. They were infected with the Delta variant of the coronavirus,” said Li Huifang, deputy secretary general of the Zhengzhou municipal government, at a press briefing on Monday. So far, the city has put 272 close contacts and 585 sub-close contacts under quarantine. The city started mass nucleic acid testing on Sunday and planned to finish it by Tuesday. “As of 18:00 on Monday, our system has seen 11.2309 million residents register for nucleic acid testing, more than the number of 10.629 million who should take the testing compulsorily. And 9.8095 million residents have had their samples taken, accounting for 92.29 percent of the residents who should take the compulsory testing. And tests for 1.4108 million residents have been completed,” said Li. The city has required all the residents not to leave the city unless necessary and those who have to do so must show their negative results of nucleic acid test taken within 48 hours. It has set up stations to check nucleic acid test results at 83 exits of expressways and highways leading to other cities. Central China’s Hubei Province reported three new locally transmitted confirmed COVID-19 cases and six asymptomatic cases on Monday, the provincial health commission said Tuesday. All the locally transmitted confirmed cases were registered in the provincial capital Wuhan. By the end of Monday, there were 24 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hubei, including six locally transmitted cases. There were also 31 asymptomatic cases under medical observation, among whom eight were locally transmitted. Wuhan has closed and disinfected all the places where the patients had visited and began to step up epidemiological investigation. The city of Xiamen, east China’s Fujian Province, reported one new locally transmitted COVID-19 case on Monday. The city took samples from 421,800 residents, or 93.8 percent of the target population, as of 22:00 Monday in the second round of mass testing in key areas. Capital Beijing reported one new confirmed case by 15:00 Monday. Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said nine close contacts had been traced. “So far, Beijing has taken measures including tracing close contacts and sealing off relevant areas. Relevant epidemiological investigation, viral genome sequencing and control work are underway in an orderly manner. According to preliminary judgment, nine people were in close contacts with the above-mentioned confirmed case, and they are under quarantine. Other close contacts are being verified,” said Pang. Beijing has locked down the neighborhood where the patient lives, its adjacent communities, and the company where the patient works, which involve more than 10,000 people. A confirmed case was reported to have traveled in Sanya City, south China’s Hainan Province, from July 28 to 30. On Sunday morning, the Sanya government closed the hotel where the patient had stayed and quarantined all the staff and customers of the hotel. At the same time, local authorities collected 1,262 samples from them and 50 samples of the hotel environment and all the nucleic acid tests showed negative results. Hainan’s capital city Haikou reported one confirmed case infected with the Delta variant on Sunday. So far the province has traced 1,650 close contacts and put them under quarantine. All of their nucleic acid tests showed negative results. ", "URL": "https://www.itnnews.lk/2023/10/05/354259/", "Category": "Breaking News,Latest News", "Parent URL": null}
