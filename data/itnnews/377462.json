In Afghanistan, around 20 percent of children are engaged in child labor, working all sorts of jobs such as street vendors, shoe polishers, car washers and garbage collectors. The number of children working full-time or part-time has increased as conflicts displaced families, while the economy declined amid pandemic. One of the working children is eight-year-old Waris who wanders at a local scenic spot in Kabul, with a bag of home-made naan, a type of specialty bread. “I sell bread to make a living because my dad lost his job,” said Waris. After his father lost his job, Waris spends after-school time selling naan every day. When there were customers, he expertly unwrapped the bag to promote his homemade naan. Another working child is Farhad who shines shoes for tourists at a scenic spot. “I clean shoes. I am in grade 5 this year. My family have to pay rent, and we have to borrow food every month. So I have to work like my father and brother,” he said. About 10 million children in Afghanistan need humanitarian assistance to survive, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). For them, their childhood is all about how to feed themselves and get through the day. “I love playing football. But I don’t have time and I have to work,” said Waris. There are few tourists in the scenic spot, giving the children time to play together. But the earning sometimes is less than a U.S. dollar a day. Around 3.2 million children are acutely malnourished and 1.1 million children are at risk of dying because of severe, acute malnutrition, said the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF). The wellbeing and even survival of Afghan children needs more attention from the international community. Almost 33,000 children have been killed and maimed in the 20-year U.S. war in Afghanistan, an average of one child every five hours, said the Save the Children.
