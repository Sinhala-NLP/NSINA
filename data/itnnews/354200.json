Under a blistering sun, the Hirofumi family posed in front of flower arrangements of the mascots, which are meant to represent both Japanese culture and the spirit of the Games and are said to have superpowers and an ability to teleport between the digital world and reality. “Although we can’t go and watch the track and field we watch it on TV and support Japan,” said Ueno Hirofumi whose daughter was wearing a t-shirt with pink-checked Paralympic mascot Someity, named after a variety of cherry blossom called Someiyoshino. The blue-checked pointy-eared Miraitowa is the Olympic mascot — combining the Japanese words ‘mirai’, meaning future, and ‘towa’, which means eternity. The temperature on Tuesday topped 30 degrees and the Okada family were trying to cool down in a mist walkway. They had just been to the Olympic village where they waved their homemade flag with the Olympic rings and the text “Gambare” which means “Do your best”. “We just came back from the Olympic Village, just to show support so we’ve just been waving at the buses, we can’t get anywhere closer to it than that so we’ve just been waving, they’ve waved back so not much we can do,” Hisanaga Okada said. He said they had tickets for several events but were now following the Games on television instead. The organisers decided to hold the games without spectators after a resurgent coronavirus forced Japan to declare a state of emergency in the capital that will run throughout the Games. “It’s a bit of a loaded question. It’s unfortunate for the kids but I guess we don’t want to spread it (coronavirus) even further to the athletes and so I guess we can do the best we can,” Okada said when asked whether he agreed with the spectator ban. The Games, from July 23 to Aug. 8, coincide with the year’s hottest weather in Tokyo, where the temperature can top 35 degree Celsius (95°F), and are one of the hottest Games on record. Not far from the mascots, a second Olympic cauldron was put on display at the Tokyo waterfront just hours after Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka ignited the flame at the opening ceremony on July 23. People will have an opportunity to see the cauldron, which was designed by architect Oki Sato and runs on hydrogen fuel, until the end of the Games.
